# Dissertation Completion Plan — Phase II Submission

**Student:** Lagad Nakul Kiran (2503032340022) · M.Tech AI & DS, PIET, Parul University
**Thesis:** Self-Reflection and Failure Recovery in Agentic AI Coding Systems
**Plan owner:** Aayush (support) · **Author:** Nakul
**Created:** 2026-09-25

---

## 0. Scope of this phase

**In scope — this is all Nakul wants to submit now:**

1. Chapter 4 — Methodology (19 sub-sections, currently 0 words)
2. Chapter 5 — Results and Discussion (13 sub-sections, currently 0 words)
3. Chapter 6 — Conclusion and Future Work (7 sub-sections, currently 0 words)
4. References (35 entries, currently missing entirely)
5. Dissertation Review Card + Compliance Report
6. All figures and tables, as editable `.drawio` files
7. Front-matter corrections in `Self.docx`

**Explicitly out of scope for now:**

- Re-running or refactoring the experiment code
- Migrating to NVIDIA NIM
- Expanding the task set beyond the existing 20
- Adding new recovery strategies (L3–L7)

Those are all documented in §8 as *future work* — which is exactly where they
belong in Chapter 6 anyway. Writing them up as planned extensions costs nothing
and strengthens the thesis.

---

## 1. One boundary, stated once

The chapters will describe **what the code actually does**. Where the current
draft claims something the implementation does not support, the fix is to
change the claim, not to write around it.

There are exactly three of these, and all three are cheap to fix:

| Current claim | What the code does | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "agentic AI coding system" | one stateless API call, no tools | call it single-shot LLM patch generation |
| "identical outcomes across the failure pool" | 8 of 24 cells never evaluated | report 16 evaluated, 8 dropped |
| "reproducible evaluation pipeline" | no temperature/seed set | state the limitation, publish the code |

None of these weaken the thesis. The corrected version is a *better* result
(see §2). This is the only place where I will not just write what is asked —
everywhere else, the plan is to write it as strongly as the evidence allows.

---

## 2. Decision log — what we established

Findings from reading `Self.docx`, the 14-page systematic review, and the full
`Dissertation-main` repository (30 scripts, 12 prediction files, 18 evaluation
runs).

### D1 — The headline finding is real, and it is not the one in the abstract

The abstract reports a flat null. The logs contain a sharper result:

```
django-11019    baseline (unified diff)   0/16 sub-tests   +33 tests broken
                Blind Retry               6/16              0 broken
                Reflection-only           6/16              0 broken
                Diagnose+Revise           6/16              0 broken
```

All three strategies land on **exactly 6**. The 0→6 jump came from the
SEARCH/REPLACE retrofit. The thesis accidentally ran a clean ablation.

> **Thesis claim to build Chapter 5 around:** changing how the edit is
> *expressed* moved the result; changing what the model was *told about its
> failure* did not.

This is defensible, quotable, and already in the data.

### D2 — The comparison matrix has holes, and they must be reported

8 of 24 condition-task cells produced no evaluable patch. In Round 1,
Reflection-only produced an applicable patch for **1 of 4** tasks. The script
prints "Not applied" and writes nothing, so the cell disappears.

Those dropped cells are the **most frequent single outcome in the study** and
are currently invisible. They become an outcome category in §4.14.

### D3 — The quota, not scientific judgement, shaped the experiment

- `master_results_table.md` says "skipped to save quota" in 4 cells, verbatim
- every script has a hard-coded `time.sleep(60)`
- Gemini free tier for `gemini-3.6-flash` is ~20 requests/day
- one clean sweep = 24 calls = more than a day's quota

This is an honest and rather good limitation to write up. It explains the
pilot's size, and it motivates the future work cleanly.

### D4 — Diagnosis made one case actively worse

On `django-11283`, Diagnose+Revise broke **8 previously-passing tests**; Blind
Retry broke none. This matches the established finding that LLM self-correction
can degrade performance. Goes in §5.7 and §5.11.

### D5 — The sample is not random

The 20 "pilot" tasks are the first 20 alphabetically — astropy and django only,
2 of the 11 repositories in SWE-bench Lite. 12 of 20 are Django. Must be
disclosed in §4.4 and §5.12.

### D6 — Benchmark validity is the biggest external threat

Human screening of SWE-bench filtered out **68.3%** of samples as
underspecified or unfairly tested (38.3% underspecified, 61.1% unfair tests).
`django-11283` fails because the test calls the patched function with `None`.
Four tasks need a solvability audit; the result goes in §5.12.

### D7 — Missing literature that strengthens the argument

Not in the 35-paper table, all directly supportive:

- Huang et al., *LLMs Cannot Self-Correct Reasoning Yet* (ICLR 2024) — the
  closest prior work; makes the Reflection-only null a **replication**
- Kamoi et al., *When Can LLMs Actually Correct Their Own Mistakes?* (TACL 2024)
- TRACEPROBE / *What Resolve Rate Hides* — the partial-credit argument, already
  cited in Nakul's own `research_gap_final.md` but never applied to his results
- SREGym's independent JEV evaluation — 40%→48%, n=50, honestly reported as
  not significant. A directly comparable honest-null.

### D8 — Cost was never measured

| Measured from the repo | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `astropy/wcs/wcs.py` pasted whole into every prompt | 31,098 tokens |
| Diagnose+Revise input vs. Blind Retry | ~3× |
| Hard-coded throttle per call | 60 s |
| Evidence kept from a 1.7 MB test log | last 3,000 chars (0.2%) |

Field standard is **Verified Recovery Rate** (recovered ÷ eligible failures)
reported *with* recovery effort. Under that pair the result reads: *0% recovery
at 3× token cost* — much stronger than a bare null.

### D9 — Front-matter defects found in `Self.docx`

| # | Defect | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | List of Figures/Tables contains **Split CIFAR-100** and "Meta-Continual Framework" from a different thesis | front matter |
| 2 | 35 citations used, **no reference list** | end |
| 3 | Three different thesis titles across four certificates | front matter |
| 4 | Cover says "System" (singular) | cover |
| 5 | Supervisor "Ramirzaja" vs "Ramizraja" in submitted Elsevier manuscript | review PDF |
| 6 | Publication certificate says "has published/accepted"; it is only submitted | front matter |
| 7 | TOC page numbers are placeholders (13, 13, 13, 14…) | TOC |
| 8 | Ch 1 defines RQ1–RQ4; Ch 2 defines a different RQ1–RQ5 | Ch 1, Ch 2 |
| 9 | Ch 1 section titles don't match TOC (1.4, 1.6) | Ch 1 |
| 10 | Figure 3.2 referenced nowhere; figure numbering inconsistent | Ch 1, Ch 3 |
| 11 | Duplicate "Tool and Execution Failures" box in taxonomy figure | Ch 3 figure |
| 12 | Positioning figure is the same diagram pasted twice side by side | Ch 3 figure |
| 13 | `astropy-14182` dropped for RECITATION (model safety block = memorised training data) — undisclosed | not written |

---

## 4. Writing order

Dependency-ordered. Each session produces something finished. **Do not reorder**
— later sessions consume decisions fixed in earlier ones.

### Session 1 — Foundation (no prose)

Lock the facts everything else cites.

1. Build the **master data table** from `report.json` files: per task, per
   condition, per round → `resolved`, FAIL_TO_PASS n/m, PASS_TO_PASS broken,
   apply-status
2. Write the **config table**: model ID, SDK, temperature (unset — record as
   such), context sizes, throttle, date of run
3. Reconcile **RQ1–RQ5** into one canonical set (keep Ch 2's five; make Ch 1
   point to them)
4. Lock the **outcome taxonomy** (5 categories, §4.14)

*Output:* `reports/data/master_table.md`, `reports/data/config.md`, `reports/data/rq_canonical.md`

### Session 2 — Chapter 4, first half (4.1–4.9)

Setup and infrastructure. Nothing here depends on results.

- 4.1 Experimental Overview → **Fig 4.1**
- 4.2 Research Questions and Evaluation Design
- 4.3 Dataset and Benchmark
- 4.4 Task Selection → disclose D5 (alphabetical, not random)
- 4.5 Model and Access Configuration → the config table; disclose D3 (quota)
- 4.6 Repository Context and Task Preparation → **Fig 4.2**, the 31k-token point
- 4.7 Oracle-Based File Localization → frame as *strengthening* the null
- 4.8 Patch Representation and Application → **Fig 4.3**
- 4.9 Evaluation Infrastructure → SWE-bench harness, Docker, WSL

### Session 3 — Chapter 4, second half (4.10–4.19)

The three conditions and the controls.

- 4.10 Baseline Evaluation
- 4.11 / 4.12 / 4.13 the three strategies → **Fig 4.4** (information-flow
  comparison — the single most important figure in the thesis)
- 4.14 Metrics and Outcome Classification → **Fig 4.5**; add the dropped-patch
  category (D2); add sub-test scoring (D1)
- 4.15 Fairness Retrofit → **Fig 4.6**
- 4.16 Second Recovery Round
- 4.17 Reproducibility and Experimental Controls → honest: temperature unset
- 4.18 Ethical and Practical Considerations → quota, cost, RECITATION (D9-13)
- 4.19 Chapter Summary

### Session 4 — Chapter 5, first half (5.1–5.6)

Pure reporting. No interpretation yet.

- 5.1 Baseline Results → **Table 5.1**, **Fig 5.1**
- 5.2 Baseline Failure Classification
- 5.3 The Patch-Formatting Confound → the discovery narrative
- 5.4 Results After the Fairness Retrofit → **Fig 5.2** (the 0→6 jump, D1)
- 5.5 Round 1 → **Table 5.2** with holes marked (D2)
- 5.6 Round 2 → **Table 5.3** with holes marked

### Session 5 — Chapter 5, second half (5.7–5.13)

Interpretation. This is where the marks are.

- 5.7 Cross-Strategy Comparison → **Fig 5.3**; include D4 (the 8 regressions)
- 5.8 Interpretation of the Null Result
- 5.9 Formatting Reliability vs. Reasoning Correctness → **the D1 thesis claim**
- 5.10 Methodological Findings
- 5.11 Comparison with Literature → Huang et al. as replication (D7); SREGym
- 5.12 Threats to Validity → D5, D6, D3, small n, single model
- 5.13 Chapter Summary

### Session 6 — Chapter 6 + References

- 6.1–6.7, answering each canonical RQ explicitly
- 6.6 Future Work absorbs everything from §0 "out of scope": NVIDIA migration
  for throughput, n≥5 per condition, stratified sampling, SWE-bench Verified,
  strategies L3–L7, cost-aware metrics
- References: 35 existing + 4 from D7, IEEE style

### Session 7 — Figures, tables, front matter

- Generate all 11 `.drawio` files (§6), export PNG at 300 dpi
- Rebuild List of Figures and List of Tables from scratch (kills D9-1)
- Apply all 13 front-matter fixes
- Regenerate TOC (F9 in Word)
- Assemble appendices

## 5. Figure manifest

All produced as editable `.drawio`, exported to PNG. Numbering is continuous
with Chapters 1–3, which already use Figures 1.1–1.3 and 3.1–3.3.

| 4.2 | Repository Context Preparation | 4.6 | Gold patch → target file → whole-file paste. Annotate 31,098 tokens. |
| 4.3 | Patch Representation and Application | 4.8 | SEARCH/REPLACE → match → programmatic diff. Include the three failure exits. |
| 4.4 | **Information Available to Each Strategy** | 4.11–4.13 | Three columns. What enters the prompt at L0 / L1 / L2. **Most important figure in the thesis.** |

| 4.6 | Fairness Retrofit — Before and After | 4.15 | Unified diff pipeline vs. SEARCH/REPLACE pipeline. |
| 5.1 | Baseline Outcome Breakdown | 5.1 | 12 pass / 4 logic fail / 4 malformed, of 20. |
| 5.2 | Sub-Test Recovery, django-11019 | 5.4 | The 0→6 jump + 33→0 regressions. **The money figure.** |
| 5.3 | Cross-Strategy Comparison Matrix | 5.7 | 4 tasks × 3 strategies × 2 rounds, holes marked as holes. |
| 5.4 | Recovery Cost by Strategy | 5.7 | Token cost per attempt vs. outcome (D8). |
| 6.1 | The Recovery Ladder | 6.6 | L0–L2 evaluated, L3–L7 as future work. |

**Replaces from Ch 3:** Fig 3.1 (duplicate box, D9-11) and Fig 3.3 (double
paste, D9-12) get redrawn in the same pass.

## 6. draw.io workflow

### Install fix needed first

The repo was cloned one level too deep. Claude Code looks for
`~/.claude/skills/drawio-skill/SKILL.md`, but it is currently at
`~/.claude/skills/drawio-skill/skills/drawio-skill/SKILL.md`, so the skill will
not be discovered by name.

```
# move the inner skill folder up one level
mv ~/.claude/skills/drawio-skill ~/.claude/skills/_drawio-tmp
mv ~/.claude/skills/_drawio-tmp/skills/drawio-skill ~/.claude/skills/drawio-skill
rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/_drawio-tmp
```

Verified working either way — scripts run fine by absolute path.

### Toolchain status

```
python 3.14.5   ok
drawio          /opt/homebrew/bin/drawio      ✅
graphviz (dot)  /opt/homebrew/bin/dot         ✅
capabilities    xml_generation · semantic_ir · sync
                native_export · auto_layout   all true
```

### Approach per figure

- **Fig 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 5.3** — hand-authored XML. Precise styling matters and
  node counts are low.
- **Fig 4.1, 4.3** — hand-authored XML with explicit swimlanes.
- **Fig 5.1, 5.2, 5.4** — data figures. Generate from the master table so the
  numbers cannot drift from Chapter 5's prose.
- **Fig 6.1** — ladder layout, hand-authored.
- **Fig 3.1 redraw** — `autolayout.py` if it exceeds 15 nodes.

### Conventions to fix before drawing

One style file applied to all 11, so the thesis looks like one document:

- Greyscale-safe (examiners print in B&W) — never encode meaning in colour alone
- One font, one size scale
- Evaluated vs. not-evaluated distinguished by **line style**, not colour
- Every figure captioned `Figure N.M — Title` and referenced in the body text
- Export at 300 dpi PNG; keep the `.drawio` alongside for later edits

## 7. Source-of-truth data

Chapters must cite these, not re-derive them. All verified from the repo.

**Baseline (20 tasks):** 12 PASS · 4 genuine logic FAIL · 4 malformed-patch ERROR

**The 4 genuine logic failures:**
`astropy__astropy-7746` · `django__django-11019` · `django__django-11283` · `django__django-11564`

**Round 1 evaluated cells:** Blind Retry 2/4 · Reflection-only 1/4 · Diagnose+Revise 4/4
**Round 2 evaluated cells:** Blind Retry 3/4 · Reflection-only 3/4 · Diagnose+Revise 3/4
**Total:** 16 of 24 evaluated, 8 dropped

**Sub-test scores (FAIL_TO_PASS):**

| Task | Baseline | All three strategies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| astropy-7746 | 0/1 | 0/1 |
| django-11019 | 0/16 (+33 broken) | 6/16 (0 broken) |
| django-11283 | 0/1 | 0/1 (Diagnose: +8 broken) |
| django-11564 | 0/2 | 0/2 |

**Config:** `gemini-3.6-flash` · google-genai SDK · temperature **unset** ·
top_p **unset** · seed **unset** · 60 s throttle · `princeton-nlp/SWE-bench_Lite`
test split · oracle file localization from gold patch · single file per prompt

**Excluded:** `astropy-14182` (RECITATION safety block) ·
`django-11039`, `django-11583` (resolved under old tooling, not retrofitted) ·
`django-11620` (recovered by all three — the one success)

---

## 8. Future work bank (for §6.6)

Everything descoped in §0, written up as planned extensions:

1. **Throughput** — migrate to an OpenAI-compatible endpoint with 40+ RPM
   (NVIDIA NIM free tier, no card) to remove the ~20 req/day ceiling that
   constrained this pilot
2. **Statistical power** — n≥5 runs per condition per task with temperature and
   seed pinned; report means and variance
3. **Sampling** — stratified random draw across all 11 repositories rather than
   the first 20 alphabetically
4. **Benchmark validity** — re-run on SWE-bench Verified (human-screened)
5. **Multi-model** — Qwen / DeepSeek / Llama families; turns "single model" from
   a limitation into a generalizability claim
6. **Strategy ladder** — L3 constrained decoding, L4 tool-grounded loop,
   L5 checkpoint/rollback, L6 circuit breaker, L7 failure memory
7. **Cost-aware metrics** — Verified Recovery Rate reported with recovery effort

---

## 9. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Examiner asks "why is this an agent?" | Renamed in §1. Answer prepared. |
| Examiner checks the 4 tasks are solvable | D6 audit in §5.12; state it before being asked. |
| "Why only 20 tasks?" | D3 quota, disclosed in §4.5 — a real constraint, honestly stated. |
| "Why do the tables have gaps?" | D2, reported as an outcome category rather than hidden. |
| Reference list not finished in time | Start it in Session 1 as background work, not Session 6. |
| Figures drift from prose numbers | Generate data figures from the master table (§6). |

---

## 10. Repository layout

The writing phase's material moved under `reports/` on 2026-09-26, so the project
root holds documents and the two working directories, nothing else.

```

**A path note that matters if a script is ever re-run.** Every script in
`reports/data/` derived the project root as its own parent directory. After the
move that would have resolved to `reports/`, so `Self.docx` would not have been
found. They now carry two anchors — `REPORTS` for `figures/`, `ROOT` for the
project root — and `build_master_table.py` was re-run to confirm it: 42 records,
**byte-identical output**, so the move introduced no drift.

The prose strings inside `write_ch*.py` still say `data/config.md` in a few
places. That is deliberate: those scripts are the provenance of the submitted
text, and editing their content would make them no longer match what produced
`Self.docx`. Only path anchors and usage comments were touched.

---

## 11. Current phase — implementation

The document is done. Work moved to `recovery-bench/`, which builds the §8
future-work items as a real program. Full rationale in
`recovery-bench/docs/DECISIONS.md` (D0–D14); the build order is
`ARCHITECTURE.md` §6.

| Step | State |
| --- | --- |
| 0 · archive provenance, freeze the task set | ✅ 495 files checksum-verified; 300 instances, revision-pinned |
| 1 · workspaces, types, config schema, `doctor` | ✅ every gate passes offline |
| 2 · `edits/` + tests | ✅ 138 tests |
| 3 · `analysis/` + `replay` | ✅ Chapter 5 regenerates byte-identically, offline |
| 4 · providers + budget ledger | next — the first live call |
| 5–8 · strategies · sweep · dashboard · extensions | planned |

Three constraints, decided and fixed: **TypeScript on Bun** (D10), **no Docker
anywhere** (D6), **conditions live in config, not scripts** (D9).

### Findings that post-date the submitted document

Recorded here because they are the reason the implementation was worth building,
and because a viva question may reach them. **None of them change `Self.docx`.**

1. **The format-class finding, quantified** (D14). 61 real model patches survive
   in `Dissertation-main`, inside the `predictions*.json` files — the only trace
   left of what the models wrote, since `attempts/` is gone. Validated
   structurally: **model-written diffs 30/51 clean (58.8%), programmatically
   generated 10/10 (100%)**. 16 count mismatches, 6 with no file header at all.
   Measured offline, no API call.

2. **The mechanism is not what the prose implies** (D13). `git apply` *forgives*
   a wrong hunk start line — it rescans for the context. What it refuses is an
   inconsistent hunk length count and misquoted source text. So the decisive
   weakness is reproducing surrounding source exactly, not line arithmetic in
   general. SEARCH/REPLACE removes both defects at once, which is a stronger
   account of the same result.

3. **Three defects in the original edit applier**, each now a regression test:
   the non-greedy regex broke on `=======` inside a REPLACE body; `"".count()`
   reported an empty SEARCH as *ambiguous*; an unterminated block was
   indistinguishable from no blocks at all.

4. **Twenty-two evaluations were invisible to the original tables** (D15). The
   archive holds 95 evaluated instance directories but only 73 `report.json`
   files. The SWE-bench harness raises before writing its report when `git apply`
   refuses the patch, and `build_master_table.py` globs for `report.json` — so
   every cell whose patch never applied vanished from the analysis. This is the
   "a failed cell leaves no record" defect, found in the project's own data.

5. **The logic/format split is now derived rather than typed** (D16). In
   `build_master_table.py` it is a hand-written dict, and the four format-class
   rows of Table A are a literal — it could not derive them, because an apply
   failure produces no report to read. Recomputing the split from outcomes gives
   **exactly the hand-written answer**: all 8 pool tasks, both classes, no
   discrepancy. The submitted numbers are correct; what is new is that something
   now checks them. `master_table.md` regenerates byte-for-byte from an
   independent implementation, and every Chapter 5 figure dataset is pinned
   against the literals in `make_figures.py`.

6. **Two corrections to this plan's own evidence.** D0 claimed the code was never
   version-controlled — wrong, the check ran against the enclosing home-directory
   repo; the code is at `Lagadnakul/Dissertation`. And SWE-bench Lite spans **12**
   repositories, not 11 — flask was missing, with 3 instances, which is exactly
   what the `per_repo_min: 3` floor was set against.

---

## 12. Next action

Step 4 — `providers/` + the budget ledger: the first live model call, with a
token ceiling that is enforced rather than documented, and usage captured per
cell. The archive has no usage records at all — the original never wrote any —
which is why figure 5.4's cost multipliers are the one Chapter 5 quantity step 3
could not derive.
